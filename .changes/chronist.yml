  Fixed a bug in invocations to send empty objects instead of null when no properties are
  specified.
details:  |-
  Fixed a bug in resource invocations where DSC would send a null string to resources when no
  properties are specified. This caused some resources to fail, because they expect a JSON
  object as input. Instead, DSC now sends an empty object, which may be valid for resources
  that define their [instance schema][aaa] without any required properties.
